Description: The svmu program (github.com/mahulchak/svmu) produces output in a
    custom tab-separated format that cannot readily be used by other software.
    The objective of this package is to provide functions to process that output.
    It includes functions for reformatting variant calls, filtering them, and
    converting their format to sequence-explicit VCF format for tools such
    as graph genotypers that require explicit sequence.
